        By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the
        order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex
        container.

      <h2 class="title">Flex-Grow</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It
        accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. If all items have
        flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be
        distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value
        of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the
        others (or it will try to, at least).
